Description of Gear,Details of gear used,
Effort,Numerical measurement of effort,
Quantification of Effort,Units of effort measurement,
Sampling_Method,Type of sampling undertaken:,
,Assessment - No block net was used. Fish were captured from a variety of locations at the site.,
,Depletion - A block net was used to isolate the site. Fish were captured from the same location until the isolated site was perceived to be depleted.,
,Repeated - No block net was used to isolate the site. Fish were captured from the same location several times.,
,Standardized - Gear types are deployed and fished in a consistent repeatable manner for fish community assessments.,
,"Targeted - The deployment of gears and degree of effort is focused on the detection and capture of specified species, not on performing standardized and repeatable sampling.",
